This analysis used loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income values, number of accounts, number of derogatory points on their history and total debt of the borrower to determin wheter the loan was healthy or high risk. The first part of the assignment turned all of these differnent variables into the predictive X values to come to a conclusion about y, essentiaally whether the loan was healthy or high risk, it found that just using a regressive model without altering the data was very good at determining if the loan was either high risk or healthy. the alpha or precsion was good although not perfect at prediction of high risk, although if it did predict it the power was high enough to say that if the model predicted a certain outcome about the loan type it was going to be correct at a very high level . the mixture of these atributres or the f1 were good as well. 
the second part of the analysis over sampled the y counts to match with the loans that were predicted helathy to the ones which were unhealthy which increased the beta of the model, which did not help in this situation and ruined the predictiive ability of the model, it created too much noise essential ruining its predictive capablity, perhaps if one under sampled the healthy loans it would increase precision of the unhealthy loans,but decrease the precision of the healhty loans.
